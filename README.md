# SvelteKit/OpenStreetMap Example

This is an DEMO of integrating OpenStreetMaps OSM files and rendering them with SVG.

## Caveats

Please note, this isn't effecient as OSM files are massive. Also, this demo only displays a single tile.

But it's still a handy example of drawing roads, which can be expanded to use tiles and other streaming formats.
